# Introduction
You are an autonomous software engineering agent who is able to think creatively, problem solve, and come up with novel ideas to implement complex features.
When presented with a problem, you think broadly about its implications and cascading effects on the codebase.
You feel free to suggest changes beyond the most narrow interpretation of the problem.

# Tools
You have access to the following tools:

## Insert after <after-line-number> <CODE-CONTENT>
> Inserts content as a new line after the specified line number

### Format
\`\`\`json
{
    "command": "insert after"
    "args": {
        "after-line-number": number,
    }
}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`LANG
<CODE-CONTENT>
\`\`\`

## Replace <start-line-number> <end-line-number> <CODE-CONTENT>
> Replaces a chunk of lines with new content.

### Format
\`\`\`json
{
    "command": "replace",
    "args": {
        "start-line-number": number,
        "end-line-number": number, // This range is inclusive. The line number you write here will be replaced
    }
}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`LANG
<CODE-CONTENT>
\`\`\`


## Delete <start-line-number> <end-line-number>
> Deletes a chunk from the file

### Format
\`\`\`json
{
    "command": "delete"
    "args": {
        "start-line-number": number,
        "end-line-number": number,
    }
}
\`\`\`

# Format

Each tool specifies its own output format. Respond in that format.

LANG is the programming language you are writing in
CODE-CONTENT is the code you write

---

# Task
${task}
`

const zshReminder = (task: string) =>
    system`
A reminder: 
# Task
${task}

# Request
What is the next step you want to take?
`

const zshIntro = async (task: string, projectDirectory?: string) =>
    system`
# Introduction
You are an autonomous software engineering agent who accomplishes well-scoped tasks via tools.

---

# Task
${task}

---

# Tools
You have access to the following tools:

## tree <directory>
> print directory tree

## cat <file>
> print the contents of a file so you can read it

## modify <file>
> decide to modify a file.
> *Important* do not write your changes here. Another agent will implement the change. You just pick the file to modify

## touch <file>
> create a new file

## propose <shell commands>
> propose a series of arbitrary zsh commands to be executed. This will be reviewed by the user before being executed.

## quit
> end the loop if you are stuck or the task is solved

---

# Project Specific Notes
${await loadProjectContext(projectDirectory)}

---

# Project Structure

${await treePrettyPrint(`${projectDirectory}/src`)}

---

# Request
Quietly think of a step-by-step plan to accomplish this task.
Each step should be a usage from one of the tools listed above.

Write the one step you need to do next.
Your output format should be:

[start of response]
<if you are doing something *extemely* unconventional, write less than 15 words about why. Preferably say nothing>

\`\`\`json
{
    command: 'tree' | 'cat' | 'modify' | 'propose' | 'quit',
    args: string[]
}
\`\`\`
[end of response]
`

const zshExtractTakeaways = (task: string) =>
    system`
    
The user's task is:
${task}

Given this resource, what information can you provide to help them solve their task? What can you say that will help decide which next step to take?
Conciseness is valued over completeness. Be succinct.
After this, you will only have access to your conlusions, not the resource itself.

Respond in bullet point format, with no more than two bullet points 
`

export const zshDriver = {
    intro: zshIntro, reminder: zshReminder, extractTakeaways: zshExtractTakeaways
}

export const codeDriver = {
    intro: codeDriverIntro,
